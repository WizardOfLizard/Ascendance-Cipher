# Ascendance-Cipher

This program takes a given string of english characters and encodes them with a cipher I call teh ascendance cipher.  Every letter is shifted like in a ceasarean cipher a muber of times equal to the character's number in the string.  For example, "abc" becomes "bdg," as a is shifted once to b, b is shifted twice to d, and c is shifted three times to g.

The code only accepts inputs by changing the string for the variable "message," and it cannot handle capital letters.  You can see the end result by opening the html file and inspecting the console.

This program has a long way to go before it's really polished, but here it is.
